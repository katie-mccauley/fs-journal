## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

  A Pseudo-Class when action is done (ex. hovering over a button) which results the element to change a style done by that action

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

  Specificity decides which CSS property values are thr most inportant to an element, which will result for it to be applied. For example, if I create a certain style for button element, I will make all of the 3 buttons blue, but if second blue class="second" and the class second color is purple, the color of the button will be purple. But you can still have the rest of the buttons colors as blue. 


3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

  !important feature doesn't effect the specificity but it directly with the part selected. Specificity is important to be effected and marked becuase it is a more effective way to determine the most important element
