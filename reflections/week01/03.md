## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

    Use two or three colors for the font and use two font weights. I think this is important because when a desgin has to many colors. it can be to much going on and important to have consistency. 

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

    I think the icon website(font awesome) is a good source when desgining 
    also a color website Dribbbles color search. I think the Boise CodeWorks websites is a good example of desgin because of the good structure and color palate. 

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

    The desgin of the webstie attracts the user into the websites purpose. If the website is unclean, not clear, and unorgaized the user might get complicated and dislike the look the website which will make users not want to use or get to know the website. When the website is clear and good structure with a great color palate, people will be drawn and want to know more.
