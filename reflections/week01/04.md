## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

    Wire-framing makes the outline of the structure and desgin of where images, styles, and other objects should go. Typically UX desginers use this so they can have the outline of where the images, icons, styles, and text should go on a website and media.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

    There is low-fidelity, middle-fidelity, and high-fidelity wireframes. Low is the starting point becuase it is usally rough, getting the desgins started, not very detailed additions to the color or style(the basic overview). Middle is more accurate and detailed and common wireframe out of the three, and more accurate layout and more detail to certain objects. High includes the pixel layouts, which includes more dimension and depth. 

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

    Wire-frames are worth the TEE because when creating a website, you need an strong outline of structure of desgin, images, text, icons, and others. This can save time by not having to constantly changning things around. Know where things need to go saves time and confusion.
