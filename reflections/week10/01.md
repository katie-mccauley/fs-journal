## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

   value type, reference type, pointer type. Value- holds data within its own memory space. Reference tpye doesn't hold value directly, stores the adress where the vlaue is being stored(contains a pointer.)

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
  
   the value is more about numbers and a reference is more with strings and characters and arrays.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

The refernece type just passes the variables adress, where as the value passes data inside memory
