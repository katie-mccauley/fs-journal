## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

a column has list of values of id.... and rows keeps track of how many

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

   CREATE TABLE characters(
     id int NOT NULL
      name TEXT NOT NULL,
      age int, 
      description TEXT NOT NULL
   )

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
DELETE is deleting a value in a table but drop table is deleting all of the tables values
