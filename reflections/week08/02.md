## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

   Everyone needs to be on the same page and know what everyone is doing. Communicating about roles and ideas are important because you don't want two people working on the same thing and code on the same file. So communicating can save future problems 

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

   Only one sprint at a time witch means everyone works at one thing at a time and not on the same thing. Also, practing these can help to work in future big teams 

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

    quality, price, and speed. Always get 2 out of 3, never all. This can vary of importance, if you want a fast job, then speed is important. But if quality is important, than quality is more important than speed.
