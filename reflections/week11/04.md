## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I feel confident for the final because during the lecture I understood what we did. I am concered about the little things that might hold me up on the final, but timeboxing is very important and taking a break from a task and moving on to a different task.
