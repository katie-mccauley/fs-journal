## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

    the get and the proxy. Get is a basic object operation. Proxy is an object but access the data.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

    you have to have return statement becuase it expects an outcome 

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

    This is esstienal when using encapsulation because the proxy is in the appState wiith the defined varable. Being able to acess the variables in the proxystate is esstienal when getting them from different files, even when maniplating data
