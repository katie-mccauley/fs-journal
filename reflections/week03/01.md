## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

    Export can only be public, so anything you put in there, it is going to be public for the people to see

2. How does export differ from export default?

    Everything in a ES6 module is private by default. Exports the reference to the exported default variable. But exporting the dedault varaible, do not receive the refernece to the exported variable. 

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

    The benefit of using the module system is that orangizes your javascript files organzies them into each purpose. Controller: gets the data, Services: mainuplates data, AppState: hold the data varaibles, Models: is the data
