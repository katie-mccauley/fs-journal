## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

    The purpose is to hide as much data as possible from the user. Also, it is bundling the data and rhe methods that act on that data, and accessing that data outside the file 

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

    These are method that dont intend the users of the api to call directly, they are only used internally. Closures don't include private properties

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

    create a function or variable above or outside of the constructor, usally it is function (like the draw function) that we created outside of the constructor
