## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

    function name(parameters) need a agurmnet in order for the function to be invoked
    let name = function(p) this has no name and cannot be used or invoked before they are defined
    let name = (p) => {} it is a another way to write a function but just as a arrow function

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

    function name(p)
    name(people)
    paramter can be any word but just signals needs an input in order for the function to work, usally the parameter name is related to what to put in
    the arugment is what you put in the function when invoking it. 

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

   it is when the function accepts the other function as a parameter or when it returns the function with the paramter, then using the filter or map method

    I learned that when you have a parameter, you invoke the function with an argument. If there isn't an arugment then the function be invoked becuase in order for it to work the aurgment is used in the function to solve the problem.
