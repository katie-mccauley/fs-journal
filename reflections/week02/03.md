## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

    evaluate conditonal statements, read printed messages or errors, view data from your JS files, test functions
    Evaluating conditional statements can test the statements you want to run and see what the outcome is. Reading the errors and tell you where they are coming from which can help debug the issue. Before testing the functions in JS, it is good to know if the button or element works relating to the function. 

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

    The elements tab, this can be useful because you can invoke a function in the html(when clicking a button or when you have an id and want to acess it in the DOM in JavaScript). This can help when debugging HTML becuase you can see where the broken function is invoked in the html. 

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
    
    The console.log in the function is helpful to see if the function related to the element connected with it in html or in a template is working. Also, debugeer in the JS is good, becuase it let you know specically where the problem is

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment


    I learned more about how to use all arrays to use the same draw function. Also, I am getting better at using the template for iterating through the arrays. Making arrays using the same draw function helps create cleaner code. Also, if creating a multiplie functions that do the same thing should be shortened into one function.
